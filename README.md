## Project Purpose
This project involves the practice of making data visualizations for the web using JavaScript and Plotly.

## Project Summary
Rosa, a biological researcher is interested in bacterial species that have the ability to synthesize proteins that taste like beef, wants to create a webpage for her test subjects. She has partnered with a food startup company called "Improbable Beef" to research and discover bacterial species that can be utlized in the beef-flavored protein synthesis project. She believes that bacterial species found colonizing the belly button are worth investigating. Rosa sampled the belly buttons of people across the country in order to identify the bacterial species present in each subject. She needs a website dashboard which allows for test subjects to select their ID number and which will subsequently display information about which bacterial species were found and their relative abundance.
